## 2.1 Overview

## 2.2 What is measurement?

### Definitions

Measurement

> "Measurement is the quantification of a construct by assigning numerical values or qualitative labels based on a set of rules, principles, or operations." (p. 31)

Constructs

> "A construct, trait, or domain is a theoretical entity or concept, such as reading ability, intelligence, or executive functioning." (p.32)

In psychology, we cannot usually measure constructs directly as they are **latent** (unobserved) so instead must measure their manifestations. We do this by developing 'items' in measurement instruments.
